Both DCGAN and CDCGAN run in similar ways. 

They must be saved in folder inside the folder dataset, ie. (..\dataset\DCGAN\)

To run both files, you must have created the folder ALL DATA (..\dataset\Data)

DCGAN: convolutional GAN
	The cost function is the cross entropy loss plus one ressemblence term ponderated by the term alpha (line 253).
	Inside the code you must choose which dataset you to run ( autonomous or human) and specify the path (line 44). 
	To validate the results, you can use "Result analysis" ( ..\dataset\Validation\Result analysis\)

CDCGAN: conditional DCGAN
	The cost function is the cross entropy loss plus one ressemblence term ponderated by the term alpha (line 275).
	Inside the code you run both datasets ( autonomous or human) simultaneously by specifying the path (../Data/All data/) (line 44). 
	To validate the results, you can use "Result analysis CDCGAN" ( ..\dataset\Validation\Result analysis CDCGAN\)
